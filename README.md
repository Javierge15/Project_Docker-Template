# Docker Template
This is a small template for creating Docker environments on a fast and easy way.

## How To
Just change the folders and scripts inside the workspace directory, and optionally the names of the containers and dependencies. Then:

### Generate the image
```bash
./gen_container
```
(Only the first time)

### Run the image
```bash
./run_container
```
